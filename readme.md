# To Leet
## This code converts english to leet.
This is the refactored code. The original code, along with the readme, is in the depricated-initial branch.

### Worked on using slices to parse the string 
- Worked on for digit loop. Works correctly when in single digits, but fails on the subsequent placeholders. Need to pu in an if statement to run this code  ony if the number is a single digit.

### It shouldn't be this hard

# To Roman
## Works as expected
- Returns a list of numbers found in the text converted to Roman Numberals.  Roman Numerals do not work above 4999, so I have used the convention of taking the number of thousands as a muliplier to the letter "M" and prepended that to the standard roman numeral
