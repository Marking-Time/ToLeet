# To Leet
## This code converts english to leet.
This is the refactored code. The original code, along with the readme, is in the depricated-initial branch.

# Find Numbers
### Uses regx to extract the numbers from an input string. Returns a list.

# To Roman
## Works as expected
Returns a list of numbers found in the text converted to Roman Numberals.  Roman Numerals do not work above 4999, so I have used the convention of taking the number of thousands as a muliplier to the letter "M" and prepended that to the standard roman numeral


### To Do
- Consider creating a dictionary for the to_roman() code. Using Index lookups might be easier than too many if statements
