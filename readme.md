## To Leet

### This code converts english to leet.
### To Do:
- Roman Numeral Conversion - The existing code only converts the digits  and not into the roman numeral syntax
- Consider making this into an object based program with multiple output methods -  like into other character systems
- Worked on code to convert roman numerals into arabic
  - string to int conversions may require try except logic
  - Code doesn't work properly - exits with traceback
